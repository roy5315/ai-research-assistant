## 📖 Overview

ResearchAI is a full-stack Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application that allows users to upload PDF research papers and interact with them using natural language.

Instead of relying solely on an LLM's pre-trained knowledge, the application retrieves the most relevant sections from the uploaded document using semantic search and supplies them as context to the language model. This enables grounded, document-specific answers with source attribution.

# 🧪 Tech Highlights

This project demonstrates practical experience with:

- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Semantic Search
- Vector Databases
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- FastAPI
- React
- REST APIs
- Prompt Engineering
- Embedding Models
- Full-Stack AI Application Development

---

# ⚠ Known Limitations

The public demo is hosted on Render's free tier, which provides limited memory. Large PDF documents may exceed the available resources during embedding generation.

When deployed on a higher-memory instance or run locally, the application supports significantly larger documents.
